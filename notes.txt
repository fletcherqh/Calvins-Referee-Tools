FORMATTING (HTML) STUFF:

Spacing after each entry created
Output window stays visible while scrolling down
nested dropdowns; or radio buttons; or check boxes

Display of Character information:

Title : Name : Epithet/CL Patron : Alignment (or, side) : Class w/Lvl# :Extraction/CL Religious Order

Java.Script STUFF:

Fix the broken buttons

Magic-users

Clerics
Sex; Alignment; Name (by both sex and alignment); Level title (by both alignment and sex); Patron (by alignment); Religous Order (by alignment)

NATHAN'S REQUESTS:

Eventually it would be nice to add:
A "Spell Book" button under "Character tables"
(We would then create a script for generating spell books that we could loop to for creating characters)
"Exploration checks"
(We would then create scripts for things like:
(underworld encounter checks, open doors, listen at doors, detect trap, find secret doors, etc.
(And then wilderness checks like: weather, lost, encounter, etc.)

JavaScript stuff:

Character stuff:
Include gold for pregen characters
Redo chances of magic items for character generation
Eventually make distinction between PR Convention rules and PR Friday rules!

Spell stuff:
Spell description button

Monster stuff:
Always include stats when monsters displayed, even for underworld
For wilderness encounters:
Add "Optional Woods"
determine number and whether or not in lair before displaying result
Rearrange stats and their presentation, e.g.:
"Name/s, (#-appearing), Side,
"HD# AC# mv#/# hp#
"#attacks, #d6dam, [Missile:etc., if any],
"[Spells:etc., if any]
"[Special attacks, etc., if any]"

Composition of force stuff:

Treasure stuff:

Magic item stuff:
Rework magic swords and presentation

Lair and dungeon stuff:

Rename the "Basic tables" heading to "Character tables"
Move the "castle" button under the "dragon" menu button
Delete the heading "Experimental"  and move the "village" button under the "castle" button
Then place the heading "Treasure tables" and its buttons and drop-down menu buttons
