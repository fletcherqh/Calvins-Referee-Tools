NATHAN'S REQUESTS:

Eventually it would be nice to add:
A "Spell Book" button under "Character tables"
(We would then create a script for generating spell books that we could loop to for creating characters)
"Exploration checks"
(We would then create scripts for things like:
(underworld encounter checks, open doors, listen at doors, detect trap, find secret doors, etc.
(And then wilderness checks like: weather, lost, encounter, etc.)
