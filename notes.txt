NATHAN'S REQUESTS:

GUI stuff:

Fix the broken buttons

We are going to rearrange the user interface of the web page without changing any of its content or underlying code.
For the appearance of the user interface on the web page , reorder the the following headings with their corresponding buttons and drop-down menue buttons in the following order:
NPCs
Basic tables
Names
Encounter tables
Treasure tables
Dice
Then do the following:
Rename the "NPCs" heading to "Men"
Rename the "Basic tables" heading to "Character tables"
Move the "castle" button under the "dragon" menu button
Delete the heading "Experimental"  and move the "village" button under the "castle" button
Then place the heading "Treasure tables" and its buttons and drop-down menu buttons

Eventually it would be nice to add:
A "Spell Book" button under "Character tables"
(We would then create a script for generating spell books that we could loop to for creating characters)
"Exploration checks"
(We would then create scripts for things like:
(underworld encounter checks, open doors, listen at doors, detect trap, find secret doors, etc.
(And then wilderness checks like: weather, lost, encounter, etc.)

JavaScript stuff:

Character stuff:
Include gold for pregen characters
Eventually make distinction between PR Convention rules and PR Friday rules!
Redo chances of magic items for character generation

Spell stuff:

Monster stuff:
Always include stats when monsters displayed
Rearrange stats and their presentation, e.g.:
"Name/s, (#-appearing), Side,
"HD# AC# mv#/# hp#
"#attacks, #d6dam, [Missile:etc., if any],
"[Spells:etc., if any]
"[Special attacks, etc., if any]"

Composition of force stuff:

Treasure stuff:

Magic item stuff:
Rework magic swords and presentation

Lair and dungeon stuff:

Castle stuff:

Settlement stuff:
