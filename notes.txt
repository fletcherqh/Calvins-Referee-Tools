NATHAN'S REQUESTS:

GUI stuff:

Fix the broken buttons

On the home page GUI, reorder the elements in the following way:
"NPCs" (and rename, "Character tables")
Delete "Basic tables" and place its three items under "Characters"
"Names"
"Encounter tables"
(under the encounter tables, move "castle" under "dragon")
Delete "Experimental" and move "village" under "castle" 
"Treasure tables"

Eventually it would be nice to add:
A "Spell Book" button under "Character tables"
(We would then create a script for generating spell books that we could loop to for creating characters)
"Exploration checks"
(We would then create scripts for things like:
(underworld encounter checks, open doors, listen at doors, detect trap, find secret doors, etc.
(And then wilderness checks like: weather, lost, encounter, etc.)

JavaScript stuff:

Character stuff:
Include gold for pregen characters
Eventually make distinction between PR Convention rules and PR Friday rules!
Redo chances of magic items for character generation

Spell stuff:

Monster stuff:
Always include stats when monsters displayed
Rearrange stats and their presentation, e.g.:
"Name/s, (#-appearing), Side,
"HD# AC# mv#/# hp#
"#attacks, #d6dam, [Missile:etc., if any],
"[Spells:etc., if any]
"[Special attacks, etc., if any]"

Composition of force stuff:

Treasure stuff:

Rework magic swords and presentation

Lair and dungeon stuff:
